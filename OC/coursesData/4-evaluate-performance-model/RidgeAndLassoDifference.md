Ridge regression and Lasso regression are techniques used to make linear regression models more accurate and avoid overfitting.

In linear regression, we estimate the relationships between independent variables (i.e., features) and the dependent variable (i.e., target) by finding the coefficients that minimize the errors between predicted and actual values.

The problem is that sometimes we have too many features, and some of them may not be relevant to the target variable. This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

To overcome this, both Ridge and Lasso add a penalty term to the regression equation. This penalty term helps control the complexity of the model and discourages large coefficients.

The main difference lies in the type of penalty term used:

Ridge regression uses the sum of the squared values of the coefficients (L2 regularization). It shrinks the coefficients towards zero but doesn't force them to be exactly zero.
Lasso regression uses the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 regularization). It can shrink coefficients towards zero, but what makes it different is that it can also force some coefficients to be exactly zero.
So, in simpler terms:

Ridge is like giving a gentle push to the coefficients towards zero, but they won't become zero.
Lasso is like giving a strong push towards zero, and some coefficients may become exactly zero.
As a result, Ridge regression is useful when we want to reduce the impact of irrelevant features but keep them in the model, while Lasso regression is valuable when we want to perform feature selection and only keep the most relevant features in the model.
