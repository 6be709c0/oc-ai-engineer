With the datasets and columns you've described, you can determine some elements such as revisits, however, directly computing the dwell time and bounce rate from the given data might be challenging without explicit timestamps marking the exit from each article. Still, using assumptions and existing features can help approximate some of these metrics. Let's explore how you might go about each:

### 1. Dwell Time

Dwell time refers to the amount of time a user spends reading an article. Direct measurement of dwell time would require timestamps for both when a user starts and finishes reading an article. In your dataset, you have `click_timestamp`, but no explicit 'end' timestamp.

**Workaround:** If the session size is greater than 1, you might assume that the time between two consecutive clicks within a session approximates the dwell time for the first article clicked.

- **Code Example**:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load clicks data
clicks_df = pd.read_csv('clicks_sample.csv')

# Sort by user, session, and timestamp
clicks_df.sort_values(by=['user_id', 'session_id', 'click_timestamp'], inplace=True)

# Calculate dwell time
clicks_df['next_click_timestamp'] = clicks_df.groupby(['user_id', 'session_id'])['click_timestamp'].shift(-1)
clicks_df['dwell_time'] = (clicks_df['next_click_timestamp'] - clicks_df['click_timestamp']).clip(lower=0)

# Optional: drop cases without a next click
clicks_df = clicks_df.dropna(subset=['dwell_time'])
```

### 2. Bounce Rate

Bounce rate is usually defined as the percentage of single-page sessions. However, in your dataset, you would look for sessions where the session size is 1, and it would be the only interaction in that session.

- **Code Example**:
```python
# Calculating bounce rate
clicks_df['is_bounce'] = clicks_df['session_size'] == 1

# Aggregating to find bounce rate per article
article_bounce_rate = clicks_df.groupby('click_article_id')['is_bounce'].mean().reset_index()
article_bounce_rate.rename(columns={'is_bounce': 'bounce_rate'}, inplace=True)
```

### 3. Revisits

To determine revisits, you would count the number of times a user has clicked on the same article across different sessions or within the same session but at different times.

- **Code Example**:
```python
# Counting revisits for each user-article combination
user_article_visits = clicks_df.groupby(['user_id', 'click_article_id']).size().reset_index(name='visit_count')

# Identifying articles revisited
user_article_visits['revisited'] = user_article_visits['visit_count'] > 1

# Aggregating to find article revisit stats
article_revisits = user_article_visits.groupby('click_article_id')['revisited'].mean().reset_index()
article_revisits.rename(columns={'revisited': 'revisit_rate'}, inplace=True)
```

Unfortunately, without more granular 'end reading' timestamps or explicit logs of user interactions beyond the click, calculations for exactly how long a user dwells on an article, or whether they bounced immediately due to dissatisfaction, will remain estimates. You might consider instrumenting more detailed user interaction tracking in your application to gather more precise analytics on these fronts.
